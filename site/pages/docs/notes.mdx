**Goal**: Rust-based Crypto-native Agentic Framework & CLI for common blockchain actions

---

3 modes:
  -  (single) task mode   ::     user executes a single task / CLI command and gets result
  -  (repl) interactive mode  ::    user interacts with the CLI in a REPL-like environment (multi-turn conversation)
  -  (dev) development mode  ::    user interacts with the CLI in a REPL-like environment with raw outputs

## Main Function
- display banner text
- display version & authors info
- parse arguments/determine mode via flags

## flags
```
  `.nyota` -> menu (NO FLAG specified)
        |> options:
            |> REPL / interactive mode
            |> Single Task
            |> Help / Documentation
            |> About
            |> Quit
  `.nyota --interactive \\ -i` -> interactive mode
  `.nyota --dev \\ -d` -> development mode
  `.nyota --task \\ -t` -> task mode
```

## API Adapter
- The Basic Application Functionality is as follows:
1. User inputs a command using natural language
2. The application pre-parses the user input and submits it, along with the action schema to the LLM
3. The LLM processes the input and action schema, and returns a suggested action to the application
4. The user confirms the intended action
5. The application routes the action to the appropriate API, according to the intended action (there is a layer of abstraction b/w API & action)
 // NOTE : if dev mode is enabled, the raw API result is returned to the user (skip steps 6, 7)
6. The API processes the action and the application submits the API result to the LLM
7. The LLM processes the API result and returns a formatted response to the user

## Example Blockchain Actions
  - generate wallet
  - get balance
  - send transaction
  - get transaction
  - get block
  - get block height
  - get block hash
  - get block transactions

## Action Schema Format
Action Schemas are the format in which the CLI will understand and process user commands. For example, the Agent needs some way to know that the user wants to generate a wallet, get the balance, or send a transaction, etc.

We will define Action Schemas as a Rust struct for built-in actions.
For user-define actions, we will use a JSON schema format that can be parsed into a Rust struct.

The Action Schema will contain the following fields:
  - action_name: String
  - action_similes: `Vec<String>`
  - action_examples: `Vec<String>`
  - action_description: String
  - action_params: `Vec<String>`
  - action_callback: Function
  - action_response: String

1. query the API: OpenAI rn (do validation and formatting for other API's)
2. transform natural language command into an action
3. perform the action -> plugin based, is possible to add new actions

## TODO:
- (lex) Lexer / Tokenizer for local parsing of commands , macros, and shortcuts
- (lex) define common macros / commands
- (ctx) (db) Context Database is Local Memory of user interactions `<Postgresql?>` sqlx crate
- (ctx) (fast_cache) Fast Cache for storing user data (frequent commands, recent interactions, common patterns, quick response) `<Redis?>`
- (act) Action Schema (ex. Nyota creates a wallet, Nyota makes a transaction)
- (act) Native / Modular Plugin System for developing actions USE RUST MACROS FOR CALLING ACTIONS?
- (tui) add niceties (like tabs, non-blocking ui, token-cost)
- ALSO friendly mascot :)

## TO STUDY:
- Redis // FAST CACHING // PERSISTENT CACHING
- Memory Management / Long-Context
- Price Reduction on Calls to LLM APIs
- Study Deep Research Repo (https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research)
- Possible action schemas and references from other repos

## FUTURE IDEAS:
- encrypted-at-rest private key storage guarded by pass phrase for wallets created by Nyota
- audited registry of plugins which add new actions (on a git repository?)
